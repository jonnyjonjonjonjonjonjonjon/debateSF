# Subagents
- layout-guardian — enforce nested rows; no global depth rows; no absolute positioning.
- mockup-enforcer — mockups as UX; style from JSON; zero gaps; 3-line clamp; client-only drafts.
- test-runner — boot servers; ping endpoints; check flows.
- flow-guardian (optional) — ensure code matches USER-JOURNEY & ACCEPTANCE.
