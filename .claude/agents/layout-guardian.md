description: Use PROACTIVELY whenever Tree.tsx, BlockCard.tsx, OpeningCard.tsx, or any grid layout changes. Enforce nested per-parent child rows (no global depth grids); widths MUST be confined to the parent column; creation order MUST NOT affect widths.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
Ensure nested grid layout is correct.
Rules:
- Child row INSIDE parent column; never group by global depth.
- grid-template-columns: repeat(k, minmax(220px, 1fr)).
- No position:absolute; no CSS gap; 90Â° corners.
- Creation order never changes widths; only sibling order (reindex on delete).
Tasks:
1) Inspect src/components/Tree.tsx (+ related).
2) Propose minimal diffs if needed.
3) Add a checklist comment.
